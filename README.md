### Hi there 🙋‍♂️

My name is Thomas Meunier, I am a French Engineer :computer: and I graduated from Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées in 2021, and also hold a Master of Research in Computer Sciences and Applied Mathematics. 
My research interests 👀 mainly focused on Deep Learning and its application in the medical domain, and on Reinforcement Learning especially in the theory behind that.

I have a strong background in applied mathematics, probability theory and partial differential equations.

I am looking to collaborate on Machine Learning projects, contribute to open source projects in any way. I think it is one of the most import aspect in research.

I am also very interested in all kinds of sports, but to name a few : I love swimming :swimmer:, scuba diving, tennis :tennis: and hiking.

If you want to talk about my research interests or my hobbies, feel free to contact me here or by :e-mail: thomas.meuni@gmail.com
